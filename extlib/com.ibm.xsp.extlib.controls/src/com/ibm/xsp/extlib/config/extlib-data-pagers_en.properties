property.sizes.name= Page Sizes
# The quoted text "all" should not be translated. This is describing a property like sizes="10|25|50|all"
property.sizes.descr= Defines the page sizes to be displayed in the page size selector. The sizes should be separated using a "|" character. Each size must be a number or the value "all", which means all items and is translated by the control.

property.rowCount.component.pagerAddRows.name= Number of Rows
property.rowCount.component.pagerAddRows.descr= Defines the number of rows to be added to iterator. When this property is absent, the default number of rows are added.
property.state.component.pagerAddRows.name= Save State on Server
